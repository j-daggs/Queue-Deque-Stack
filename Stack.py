#  Purpose of Stack.py:
#  The purpose of this file is to contain a class named Stack.
#  This class will be designed and contain methods so that objects may be created from it and act in the nature of a
#  stack, in which the addition and removal of items always happens at the same end â€“ known as the top of the stack
#  The data items in a stack act in a last-in first-out (LIFO) manner
#  , where the most recently added item is the item that is removed first.
